This project focuses on optimizing force-field parameters for a nano-scale cell membrane using genetic algorithms. As such, my Python code integrates parallel processing, efficient file management, and works seamlessly with GROMACS, a widely-used molecular dynamics simulation package for biomolecular studies. The results achieved through this project have been published in the paper:
