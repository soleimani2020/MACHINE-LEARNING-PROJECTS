This script aimed at optimizing force-field parameters for a nano-scale cell membrane using genetic algorithms. It integrates parallel processing, file management, and works in conjunction with GROMACS, a popular molecular dynamics simulation package for biomolecular simulations. The results obtained with this code have been published in the paper:
